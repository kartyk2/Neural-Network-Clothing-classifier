# Neural-Network-Clothing-classifier
This repository implements a machine learning model to classify fashion items from the MNIST Fashion dataset.

The MNIST Fashion dataset consists of grayscale images of various clothing articles. Each image is 28x28 pixels and belongs to one of ten categories, such as T-shirt, trouser, or sneaker. This project aims to train a model to accurately predict the category of a given fashion item image.

Project Goals:
Load and pre-process the MNIST Fashion dataset.
Build and train a machine learning model for image classification.
Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data
